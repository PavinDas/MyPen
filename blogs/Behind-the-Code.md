When I was 12 years old, I watched the Mission Impossible movie franchise for the first time. everyone was hyped about Ethan Hunt doing those crazy stunts. But while everyone else was focused on Ethan, I noticed a hacker, Luther. Every time Ethan needed a system hacked, Luther would just tap a few keys on his laptop and get it done. I was fascinated. That was the moment I knew I wanted to become a hacker like Luther.

So, I started looking into hacking. Back then, there weren’t many proper resources on the internet or YouTube. Whatever I could find just showed how to install tools on Termux and generate phishing links. No one was talking about Linux, networking, or how things actually worked. But I was curious, so I started there.

Honestly, I had no idea what I was typing into Termux. I was just following steps blindly. That made me a script kiddie, using tools without understanding them. But I didn’t stop there. After a few months, I started getting familiar with some basic Linux commands. I still didn’t fully understand  how they worked, but I knew what they did. That small bit of progress gave me a boost.

Eventually, I got this idea, What if I create my own Termux tools? 
I started digging into how tools are built, and that’s when I realized I needed to learn programming. So I jumped into C and Java. At first, it was tough. But soon, I found myself really enjoying it. I actually started loving programming.

That passion led me to explore more languages and technologies. I dove into full-stack development, learning the MERN stack and Flutter. I built over 10 mobile apps, including an AI chatbot and an image generator. Creating things felt amazing.

But throughout it all, I never forgot why I started this journey, to become a hacker. That’s when I had a moment of clarity. I realized I didn’t want to be like Luther. As cool as he was, he often used his skills in unethical ways. But hacking doesn’t have to be unethical. That’s when I discovered ethical hacking and decided to walk that path.

I began studying cybersecurity in a structured and ethical way, while continuing to strengthen my programming skills. I learned Python and started building my own security tools. Today, as a Cybersecurity Analyst, I use my skills not to exploit systems, but to protect them to **create a fearless digital environment for everyone.**

Looking back, it all started with a movie character... but today, it’s my real life mission.
